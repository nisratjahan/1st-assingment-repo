        <h1 class="center">My Recipies</h1>
        <h6 class="center">Very easy! Even with only 2C sugar and 2.26lbs of fresh figs it was way to sweet for our tastes. I’ll probably doing another batch with just orange juice and add to the current batch</h6>

                <p>Place the orange zest and orange juice in a medium (10-inch) heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, such as Le Creuset. Add the sugar, vanilla bean, and figs to the pot. Cover and bring to a full boil over medium heat. (Don't worry; it may
                    look dry.) Stir the mixture and boil hard for 1 minute, stirring to dissolve the sugar.</p>
